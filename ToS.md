# PAIDE Terms of Service [02/06/2025]

By using this SDK for development, you agree that:

* Modifications to the SDK are not allowed unless it helps fix a bug [must provide evidence of the bug beforehand]
      This includes the cfg file, and the location of the Module relative to the Assets folder.
  
* This SDK should be free and avaliable to all who wish to develop using the module
   This includes no payment required, no extra steps, no verification, etc.

* The Watermark at the start of the game should NOT be tampered with
    I can understand if the loading is getting annoying, but the instance is built in and cannot be manually removed, doing so will break the
    modifications statement above
